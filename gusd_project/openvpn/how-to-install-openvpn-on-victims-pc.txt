1. 
Install .msi openvpn installer by the following command:
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://openvpn.net/downloads/openvpn-connect-v3-windows.msi" -OutFile "C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Downloads\openvpn-installer.msi"

You have to set openVPN as a windows service in order to run and work with it silently.

After it is installed, silently execute the file without user interaction:
Start-Process msiexec.exe -ArgumentList "/i", "C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Downloads\openvpn-installer.msi", "/quiet", "/norestart" -Wait


2. 
Download .ovpn configuration file (from this directory) called "jp-free-1.protonvpn.tcp.ovpn"


3. 
By default, OpenVPN typically looks for configuration files in (C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config\) or "config" folder of custom directory

This is how to copy a .ovpn configuration file into the OpenVPN config directory:

$sourcePath = "C:\Path\To\Your\Config\file.ovpn"   # Replace with your local path to the .ovpn file
$destinationPath = "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config\file.ovpn"  # Adjust to your OpenVPN's config folder
# Copy the .ovpn file to the OpenVPN config folder
Copy-Item -Path $sourcePath -Destination $destinationPath -Force

OpenVPN typically auto-detects any .ovpn file placed in its config folder. However, if you need to launch OpenVPN from PowerShell and specify a configuration file explicitly, you can use Start-Process to run OpenVPN with a specific config file. Example to start OpenVPN with a specific .ovpn file:

Start-Process "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\bin\openvpn.exe" -ArgumentList "--config", "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config\file.ovpn" -WindowStyle Hidden -NoNewWindow

4.
After all you would like to run openVPN on the background each time user logs into its account:

# Set the path to OpenVPN and the configuration file
$openvpnPath = "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\bin\openvpn.exe"  # Adjust if OpenVPN is installed elsewhere
$configPath = "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config\file.ovpn"  # Adjust to your actual configuration file path
# Set the registry key to run OpenVPN on user login
$regKeyPath = "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"
$regName = "OpenVPN"
$regValue = "`"$openvpnPath`" --config `"$configPath`""
# Create the registry entry
Set-ItemProperty -Path $regKeyPath -Name $regName -Value $regValue
Write-Host "OpenVPN will now run automatically on login."

5.
Done
